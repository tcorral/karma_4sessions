===============

#Repository with the files created in the four sessions talk about how to use Karma.

To make it work:

* Install Node.js from [http://www.nodejs.org]

* Open a terminal and execute:
    > node -v

    You should get the number of the installed version.

* Install Karma globally
    > npm install -g karma

    It will install karma to be used from the command line.

* Change directory to this repository folder
* Install all the dependencies using
    > npm install

* To launch the U.T. execute...
    > karma start

    It will start to listen the changes in the src and test folder.

Enjoy it.
